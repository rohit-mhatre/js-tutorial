//traditional comparison:
console.log(1 > 4);
console.log(1 >= 4);
console.log(1 < 4);
console.log(1 == 4);
console.log(1 != 4);

//these will just give out the result in true or false format

console.log("2" > 1)
console.log(1 < "31")

//the comparison with null and undefined are complex, just study about them once

//strict compaison (===):
console.log(3 === "3")
console.log(3 === 3)

/**Strict comparison in JavaScript, often denoted as ===, is a type of equality comparison that not only checks if the values are equal but also ensures that the data types are the same. 
 * In a strict comparison:
    Two values are considered equal only if they have the same value and the same data type.
    If the data types are different, the values are considered not equal.
    It does not perform type coercion, meaning it does not attempt to convert the values to the same data type for comparison.
